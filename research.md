# Research Interest
Broadly speaking, my research interest focuses on understanding special metrics and their moduli spaces on manifolds, motivated by physics and topology. These metrics include locally conformally flat metrics, Yamabe metrics, non-Kähler Hermitian metrics, and hyperbolic type metrics. The tools I use to understand these structures include conformal deformation, collapsing theory of Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov, nonlinear PDE, and generalized curvature flows with surgeries. My coauthors and I have made progress on some well-known conjectures and discovered some interesting geometric phenomena.
