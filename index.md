# Xiaokang Wang (王小康)

Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine. [UCI math](https://www.math.uci.edu)

I am a fifth year Ph.D. in math. My advisor is Prof. [Jeffrey Viaclovsky](https://www.math.uci.edu/~jviaclov/). I am interested in all kinds of math. Beyond math, I love heavy metal and kick-boxing.

This is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SmrfnssAAAAJ&hl=en) page. 

I share the same English (pingying) name with several other outstanding Chinese researchers. Seems like I am the only math researcher.

## Research Interests

Geometric Analysis and Geometric Flows, epecially the collapsing behavior in the moduli space and the geometric flows. Below is a taste of my research.
