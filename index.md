# Xiaokang Wang

Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine  

I am a fifth year Ph.D. in math. My advisor is Prof. Jeffrey Viaclovsky. I am interested in all kinds of math. Beyond math, I love heavy metal and kick-boxing.

## Research Interests

Geometric Analysis and Geometric Flows, epecially the collapsing behavior in the moduli space and the geometric flows.
