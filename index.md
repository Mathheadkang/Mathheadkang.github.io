# Xiaokang Wang (王小康)

Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine. [UCI math](https://www.math.uci.edu)

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics. My advisor is Prof. [Jeffrey Viaclovsky](https://www.math.uci.edu/~jviaclov/). My research interests span various areas of mathematics. Beyond mathematics, I enjoy heavy metal music and kickboxing.

You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SmrfnssAAAAJ&hl=en) page. 

I share the same English (Pinyin) name with several other outstanding Chinese researchers, though it seems I am the only one in mathematics research.

## Research Interests

Geometric Analysis and Geometric Flows, especially collapsing behavior in moduli spaces and geometric flows. Here is a glimpse of my research.
