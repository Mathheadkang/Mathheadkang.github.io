# Research 
My research interest focuses on understanding special metrics and their moduli spaces on manifolds, motivated by physics and topology. I am also interested in applying modern learning to mathematics (AI4Math).

The modern view point of geometry is not "static" anymore. Instead, we can let the metrics of a manifold varies. See this

For expert, this is the detailed overview of my [research](./Expert/index.md).

For non-expert, this is an intuitive, high-level [introduction](./high_level_research/index.md).

If you are interested in AI4Math, please take a look at my work in [AI4Math](./AI4math/index.md).
