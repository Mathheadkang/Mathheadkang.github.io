# Research 
My research interest focuses on understanding special metrics and their moduli spaces on manifolds, motivated by physics and topology. I am also interested in applying modern machine learning to mathematics (AI4Math).

The modern view point of geometry is not "static" anymore. Instead, we can let the metrics of a manifold varies. You can click this <a href="sphere.html"><button type="button">Sphere Visualization</button></a>. This page allows you to modify a "metric" on the sphere manually. After that, you can apply Ricci flow on sphere to "smooth out" the metric and get a round sphere again.

For expert, this is the detailed overview of my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/expert/).

If you don't mind the details and want to see some cool stuffs, this is an intuitive, high-level [introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/introduction/).

If you are interested in AI4Math, please take a look at my work in [AI4Math]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/AI4Math/).
